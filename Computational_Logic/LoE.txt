LoE (Logic of Entities)
    - Domain D = <U, {C}, {R}>
        - U: universe of interpretation. {u}: set of units
        - {C}: set of classes of units
        - {R}: set of binary relations between units

    - model M
    - assertions:
        - E(e): entity e is of etype E
        - D(v): value v is of etype D
        - O(e1, e2): object property O holds between e1 and e2
        - A(e, v): data property A of entity e has value v
    - interpretation functions I: L -> D
    - theories T

    Entailment (|=)

    OWA (Open World Assumption): returns IDK when entailment does not hold.

    CWA (Closed World Assumption): returns <E(e) is FALSE> when entailment does not hold.
        Partial knowledge -> negative knowledge
