BASICS
    LEARNING PROCESS:
    - DATA AQUISITION: involves collecting relevant data for the problem at hand.

    - DATA PREPROCESSING: data needs to be 'cleaned' and prepared for analysis.
        Handling missing value, dealing with outliers. Techniques: normalization, feature scaling
        and handling categorical variables.

    - DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION: is the reduction of number of features while preserving the most 
        important information.

    - MODEL LEARNING: a model is trained on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships.
        Algorithms: linear regression, decision tree, support vector machines & neural networks
