COMPILER:
    - GRAMMAR: states and form of an assignment

    - LEXICAL ANALYSIS: translates a stream of characters into a stream of tokens
        ex. pippo = 2*3; -> <ID, pippo> ASS <NUM, 2> MUL <NUM, 3> SEMCOL 

    - SYNTAX ANALYSIS: checks whether a stream of tokens adheres to the given grammar.
        If so, converts the stream of tokens into a parse tree (AST)

    - INTERMEDIATE CODE GENERATION: converts a AST into a textual intermediate code
        ex. 
            MOVE 2, R1
            MULT 3, R1
            MOVE R1, RD

    - TARGET CODE GENERATION: translates intermediate code into target machine code

GENERATIVE GRAMMARS:
    - Vocabulary(symbols): 
        i.  terminals: play the tokens of the out stream of LEXICAL ANALYSIS
        ii. non-terminals: chosen as start symbol
    
    - Productions: rules for rewriting strings into strings (with at a least a non-terminal)
