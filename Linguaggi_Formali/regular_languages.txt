REGULAR LANGUAGES
    - L = {a^n*b^n|n>0} is a FREE language
    - STACK seems ideal to recognize words in L
    - Read the string ONE symbol at a time

    - REGULAR GRAMMARS: FREE grammars with productions of the form

    - REGEX(REGULAR EXPRESSION):
        Alphabet A and a number of operators
        Define regexes inductively:
            Base:
                Every a in A is a regex
                e is a regex
            Step:
                (Alternation)   r1|r2
                (Concatenation) r1r2
                (Kleene star)   r1*
                (Parentheses)   (r1)

        DENOTED LANGUAGE(L(r)): is also inductively defined on the structure of r
            Base:
                L(a) = {a} for every a in A
                L(e) = {e}
            Step:
                IF r = r1|r2 then L(r) = L(r1) U L(r2)
                IF r = r1r2 then L(r) = {w1w2|w1 in L(r1) and w2 in L(r2)}
                IF r = r1* then L(r) = {e} U {w1w2...wk | k >= 1 and for all i : 1 <= i <= k.wi
                    in L(r1)
                }
                IF r = (r1) then L(r) = L(r1)

        CONVENTIONS(Precedence): Kleene star > Concatenation > Alternation
            ex.
            (a|bc*) == (a|(b(c*)))

    - FINITE STATE AUTOMATA: used to decide whether a word belongs to the language denoed by a 
      regex

        Non-deterministic finite state automata(NFA): 
        tuple (S, A, move_n, S0, F)
            S: set of states
            A: alphabet (e is NOT in A)
            s0 in S: INITIAL state
            F
